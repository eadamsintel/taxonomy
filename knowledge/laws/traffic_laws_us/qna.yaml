    Overtaking, usually called "passing", is legal on all four or more
    lane roads and on most two-lane roads with sufficient sight distance.
  question: Is overtaking legal?
- answer: |
    Speed limits are set by each state or territory, as well as counties
    or municipalities, on the roads within their jurisdiction. The maximum
    speed limit on rural two-lane roads ranges from 50 mph (80 km/h) in
    parts of the northeast to 75 mph (120 km/h) in parts of Texas. On rural
    Interstate Highways and other freeways, the speed limit ranges from 60
    mph (96 km/h) in Hawaii to 85 mph (136 km/h) in parts of Texas. All roads
    in the United States have a speed limit, but it is not always posted
    (especially in rural areas).
